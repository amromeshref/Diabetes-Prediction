# Diabetes Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on a set of input features such as blood pressure, 
glucose levels, age, BMI, and other relevant factors. The model is implemented using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in PyTorch.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a person has diabetes based on various medical 
input features. The model is built using PyTorch and leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), 
which is available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of several features related to the medical history and health conditions of individuals, 
which are used to predict diabetes.

### Features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
